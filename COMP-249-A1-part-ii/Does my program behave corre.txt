Part 2: Does my program behave correctly?

Yes, our program works as expected because we created an abstract super class to all previously made classes called Vehicle which contained an abstract copy method inside it. This ensured that every subclass had a copy method that returned a new object which was a direct copy of the object the method was called on. This allowed us to create copies of all the objects in a mixed array without having to find the type of each object. It also did not require the use of clone().
The rest of the program works because in our Driver, our copyTheObjects method accepts an array of objects, creates a new array with the same length as the accepted object, and casts each element of the original array to the Vehicle class before copying it into the new array. The method then returns the newly created array.
